				<b>Axiomatic Football is a strategy game thought to be used as a first exercise to introduce various computer science related concepts and skills.</b> The students can taste the flavors of formal systems, finite automates and communication protocols, while programming strategies to win a football match in a straight-forward language.

			<h1>How does it work?</h1>
			<p>
				Each playing team specifies its strategy along four plain-text archives, to differentiate the actions when the team has the ball (offensive strategy) and when it doesn't (defensive strategy) and to locate the players on the field (offensive and defensive initial positions). The field is divided as a chess board, but (in the alpha version) as a 5 x 3 grid, when the ball reaches a certain position of the court, the engine applies the defensive actions, of the team which doesn't own the ball, correspondent to that position and the offensive actions, of the team which does have the ball. This series of actions is looped for the whole game (2 halves, 50 loops). 
			</p>
			<p>
				On the other hand, the engine also receives "output files" (in the alpha version only videos are supported), representing the basic actions of the strategy. These archives are used to create a graphical output of the match, which can be viewed as a football match <b>with an extra geek touch!</b>. More content is to come.
			</p>
			
			<h1>Use in the Real World</h1>
			<p>
				The exercise has been used for two semesters at Universidad de los Andes (Bogotá, Colombia) in the Introductory course of Systems and Computer Engineering, with around 90 students and the supervision of José Tiberio Hernandez Ph.D with excellent results.
			</p>

			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>
				Axiomatic Football was conceived and has been developed by Francisco J. Pinzón L. (pacho.me), the visualization Processing sketch was developed by Luis Eduardo Alzate.
